# CinemaTickets
Project for a university course. It's a WIP version of Spring Boot app. Main concern was to implement a system that allows users to place ticket orders.

My idea with this project was to create an app for a movie theater chain that features step-by-step process of placing a reservation. I wanted to create an app that mimics the flow of an actual, real-life web app. I've focused only on backend, since that was the scope of this course. Frontend will be done some other day.




Maybe.
